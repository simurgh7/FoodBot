# Midterm project
### 1. General Idea
In this midterm, we propose a chatbot built using Llama2, combined with our image classification model to identify and provide information about selected dishes. The image model will analyze an image of a dish and predict its name. This name will then be relayed to the chatbot, which will offer assistance regarding the dish's flavor, ingredients, and any allergy warnings. Our work provides an end-to-end solution for users seeking information about new dishes. It will help users gain general knowledge and be aware of potential allergy risks before ordering food at a new restaurant.

### 2. Demo
  in the video, we show a demo on how to use our product
